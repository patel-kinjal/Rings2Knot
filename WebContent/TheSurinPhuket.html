				Set in the heart of the Andaman Sea, Phuket is Thailand's largest island and fondly known as the  Pearl of the Andaman. Situated north of the Surin Beach headland and on the island's west coast, Pansea Beach is still a hidden gem. Only one other luxury resort shares the private bay with its clear turquoise waters and pristine white sand beach with exclusive access for guests only. Conceived in 1982, the resort was an early pioneer that brought a new level of luxury to the exotic tropical island that was relatively undiscovered at that time. Originally known as The Pansea due to its exceptional location along the fine white sand of Pansea Beach, The Surin Phuket has been revitalised over the years under the careful guidance of Ed Tuttle, one of America's most renowned architect.
                <br/><br/>
                 The Paris-based architect and designer maintains respect for both the local culture and his own architectural philosophy in ensuring that wherever one looks, an interesting perspective can be seen. His intuitive vision has ensured that The Surin Phuket remains as a timeless and classically elegant hideaway that it was conceptualised to be. Guests are assured of an unpretentious and casual ambience complemented by high service standards against the unspoilt, lush backdrop that has remained unchanged through the years.
